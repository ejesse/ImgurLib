The ImgurLib
============

The ImgurLib is a API wrapper arrownd the imgur.com Authenticated API service.
This enables you to manage imgur.com accounts without thinking too much about
the authentication. It was developed to be used with ImgurUp as some of the 
users wanted to use the application with their own accounts, but cince the 
library is extended to support almost all methods available, it is released as
a separete library.

Methods
-------

The method ImgurLib provides are as follow:
* get_auth_url() - returns a URL for authenticating the client in imgur.com
* authorize(self, PIN) - authorizes the user with a pin from the URL you get from

			you can skip the first two methods
